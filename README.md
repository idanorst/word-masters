# word-masters
This game is inspired by a project in the Frontend Masters turorial "Complete intro to Web Devs". I tried making my own version, before I watched the solution. 
I have implemented some parts if the solution, because I liked them, for example the spinner that show's while loading. 
I chose to use a table of input rows, which ended up being very complex. The version works for now, with some smaller bugs, for example with toggling through already enteres letters.  
The plan is to make another version later, less complex and without the bugs.
